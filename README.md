This game was created as a final project for Computer Scienge in grade 10.
The project was completed using Visual Basic .NET by my partner and I.

The game consists of targets labelled Q,W,E,R,D, or F falling down the screen
and a score displayed at the bottom left which is incremented by 100 for each
successful keystroke. Incorrect keystrokes or targets passing the bottom of
the screen cause an 'X' to appear at the bottom left and when there are 5,
the game ends.
